#Variables


For each record it is provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.


##Data

Data is provided in 2 different data sets composed, which of those, by three files.

For this work, the following files were used:

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

- 'train/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 


For features label the following file was used:

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.


#Work performed on data

For each set the three files were merged and also the labels were applied to simplify the work.
